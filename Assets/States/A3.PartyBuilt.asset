  description: A3.PartyBuilt state.  This allows the user to display information
    on the character we created for them, or the rest of the NPCs that make up the
    party.  They can also choose to travel to the Dungeon when ready or Quit the
    game.  Later this may want to allow for letting them choose how to modify and
    equip the character and even the NPCs.  Choosing the level range for the party
    would be useful as well so they aren't just random levels
